# 🥗 Student Nutrition Analysis 2025

## 🧩 Introduction
This project was carried out as part of the “Open Source Programming” module.  
It focuses on collecting and analyzing nutritional habits among university students using simple data tools and visualization methods.


## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to analyze the eating habits of university students in Algeria and raise awareness about the importance of a balanced diet and its impact on academic performance.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- A short survey was conducted among 40 university students from different departments.
- The questionnaire included questions about:
  - Number of daily meals.
  - Breakfast consumption.
  - Water intake.
  - Fast food and soft drink consumption.
  - Fruit and vegetable intake.

## ⚙️ Project Steps

- Created a collaborative GitHub repository for the project.


- Designed and distributed the student nutrition survey.


- Collected and organized responses in Excel.


- Analyzed results and generated visual charts.


- Summarized findings and recommendations in this README document.

 

## 📊 Key Results
| Eating Habit | Percentage |
|---------------|-------------|
| Eat breakfast daily | 55% |
| Eat fast food more than twice per week | 65% |
| Drink less than 1L of water per day | 48% |
| Eat fruits and vegetables daily | 30% |

## 📈 Analysis
The collected data shows that most students follow an unbalanced diet with a high dependency on fast food and low water consumption.  
This pattern can negatively affect concentration, energy levels, and overall health.
It can even affect students' mental health in some cases.

## 💡 Recommendations 
Based on the study results showing a strong tendency toward fast food consumption and low water and fruit intake, several practical measures can be proposed to help improve students’ eating habits:

### 🏫 At the University Level:

1. **Organize open awareness workshops on healthy nutrition**
   These sessions can be led by students from nutrition or biological sciences departments to share knowledge about balanced diets and demonstrate how to prepare simple, healthy meals at home.

2. **Launch a “Daily Water Intake Challenge”**
   Encourage students to drink 1 to 1.5 liters of water per day for two weeks, and share the challenge results on university social media pages to boost participation.

3. **Improve the on-campus food environment**

   * Provide healthy options in the cafeteria, such as salads and natural juices.
   * **Install water vending machines** in student gathering areas instead of relying only on coffee and snack machines.

4. **Design simple and inspiring reminder posters**
   Display posters in classrooms and hallways with short messages such as:

   * “Take a sip of water now 💧”
  
     The goal is to promote daily awareness in a light and easy-to-read way for everyone.



### 👩‍🎓 At the Student Level:

1. **Prepare quick and healthy homemade meals**
   Examples include tuna or egg sandwiches with vegetables, or simple salads that can be stored and eaten later.

2. **Track water intake using an app or a personal bottle**
   Use a mobile app for hydration reminders or carry a 1-liter bottle to refill throughout the day.

3. **Manage coffee consumption wisely**
   It’s best to drink coffee in the morning to boost focus and energy, avoid it in the evening to prevent sleep issues, and gradually reduce daily intake to maintain body balance.

4. **Have breakfast regularly**
   Even a light meal like milk with a banana or bread with cheese can help improve concentration and energy during morning lectures.
